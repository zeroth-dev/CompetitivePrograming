	// This is an empty class because the problem was solved mathematically
	// You can generate Pythagorean primes with the formula
	// (m^2-n^2)^2 + (2mn)^2 = (m^2+n^2)^2
	// where m and n are some positive integers
	// Set the sum of parts equal to 1000
	// and solve the Diophantine equation
	// The result is m = 20, n = 5
	// which generates a=375, b=200, c=425
	// and a*b*c = 3187500
